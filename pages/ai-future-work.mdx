# AI and the Future of Work

As AI continues to advance at a rapid pace, it is inevitable that it will have a significant impact on the future of work. Chris Dossman, an AI startup founder, shares his thoughts on how AI will reshape various industries and the role of humans in an AI-driven world.

## Automating Tedious Tasks

One of the most apparent ways AI will change the future of work is by [automating tedious tasks](/ai-future-work/automating-tedious-tasks). From data entry and content creation to repetitive manufacturing processes, AI has the potential to take over many tasks that humans find monotonous and time-consuming.

According to a study by McKinsey Global Institute, up to 45% of work activities could be automated using existing technology.

By freeing up time spent on these tasks, AI will allow humans to focus on more creative, strategic, and meaningful work. This shift will require a reevaluation of job roles and a greater emphasis on skills such as:

- Critical thinking
- Problem-solving
- Emotional intelligence
- Creativity

## The Human Element in AI Development

Despite the potential for automation, Chris emphasizes the importance of the [human element in AI development](/ai-future-work/human-element-ai-development). As AI systems become more advanced, the role of humans in designing, training, and overseeing these systems will become increasingly crucial.

### Designing AI Systems

Humans will be responsible for defining the goals, ethics, and constraints of AI systems to ensure they align with human values and societal needs.

### Training AI Models

While AI can learn from vast amounts of data, human expertise will be essential in curating training data, providing feedback, and guiding the learning process.

### Overseeing AI Deployments

As AI is integrated into various industries, humans will need to monitor its performance, identify potential biases or errors, and make necessary adjustments.

Moreover, the human touch will remain irreplaceable in many aspects of work, particularly those that involve empathy, creativity, and complex decision-making. As Chris points out, "People matter. The world exists for people because it's us. It's we're doing it all for us, for other people too."

## The Future of Work: A Human-AI Collaboration

In conclusion, the future of work will likely be characterized by a collaboration between humans and AI systems. By leveraging the strengths of both, we can create a more efficient, innovative, and fulfilling work environment. However, this transition will require a proactive approach to reskilling workers, redesigning jobs, and ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly across society.

As Chris aptly puts it, "Don't have anxiety. Get up every morning, feel excited for the fact that we can now do so much more with less, and build just every day. Wake up and build something, make life better for yourself, make life better for other people around you using the tools that you have available."
