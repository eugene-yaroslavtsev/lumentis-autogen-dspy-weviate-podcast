# FAQx and Verified Local Information

Chris Dossman's previous startup, FAQx, focused on providing accurate and up-to-date local information to users. However, the team faced significant challenges in ensuring the quality and reliability of the data, especially for smaller cities and towns.

## The Problem with Local Information

Many government websites, particularly those of smaller municipalities, often struggle with maintaining accurate and current information. Some common issues include:

- Outdated content
- Broken links
- Inconsistent formatting
- Lack of regular updates

These problems make it difficult for users to find the information they need, leading to frustration and confusion.

## A Hybrid Solution: Human-AI Collaboration

To address these challenges, FAQx developed a unique approach that combined human expertise with AI-powered tools. The process involved:

<Steps>
### Step 1

**Data Scraping**: FAQx employed a combination of AI and human workers to scrape local government websites for relevant information.

### Step 2

**Verification**: The scraped data was then verified by a team of human experts to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Step 3

**Publishing**: Once verified, the information was published on the FAQx platform, providing users with a reliable source of local data.
</Steps>

By leveraging this hybrid approach, FAQx was able to provide high-quality local information for a wide range of cities and towns across the United States.

## Scaling the Solution

While FAQx's hybrid approach proved effective, the team recognized the need to scale the solution to cover more locations and keep the information up-to-date. This realization led Chris to explore new ways of utilizing AI technology, eventually [transitioning to Dicer AI](/transitioning-to-dicer-ai) and focusing on marketing applications.

Despite the shift in focus, the lessons learned from FAQx's experience with verified local information would continue to influence Chris's approach to AI development, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and collaboration in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content.
