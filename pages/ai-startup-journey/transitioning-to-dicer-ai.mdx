# Transitioning to Dicer AI

After the success of FAQx in providing [verified local information](/ai-startup-journey/faqx-verified-local-info), Chris and his co-founders faced a critical decision when ChatGPT was released. They realized that while they had built an impressive system akin to an early version of Perplexity or ChatGPT connected to the internet, they might not be the best team to take it to the next level.

Considering their extensive background in marketing, having spent over $200 million on ads in the past decade, Chris and his team decided to pivot their focus. They wanted to leverage their AI technology to build a product that would be the best in the world at solving marketing challenges.

This pivot led to the birth of Dicer AI, a startup that aims to revolutionize marketing using advanced AI techniques. Dicer AI's core technology is built upon the same foundation as FAQx, utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and other innovative approaches to achieve exceptional performance in marketing applications.
