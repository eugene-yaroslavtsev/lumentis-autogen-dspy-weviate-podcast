# Lessons from Jason Liu

In his conversation with Chris Dossman, Jason Liu shared valuable insights on AI development and best practices. These lessons can help guide developers and entrepreneurs as they navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.

## Key Takeaways

- **Focus on input-output relationships**: Jason emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationships between inputs and expected outputs when building AI systems. By clearly defining these relationships, developers can create more reliable and efficient models.

- **Structured reasoning is crucial**: Incorporating structured reasoning techniques, such as [atomic reasoning modules](/self-discover-dspy/atomic-reasoning-modules) and [compiling reasoning for specific tasks](/self-discover-dspy/compiling-reasoning-specific-tasks), can significantly improve the quality and coherence of AI-generated outputs.

- **Verification is essential**: Whenever possible, developers should verify the outputs generated by their AI systems. This helps ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information provided, especially in critical domains such as healthcare or finance.

  Verification can be achieved through various methods, such as cross-referencing with trusted sources, manual review by experts, or implementing additional validation layers within the AI pipeline.

- **Leverage existing frameworks**: Jason encourages developers to take advantage of existing AI frameworks, such as [DSPy](/langchain-vs-dspy/dspy-advantages), which offer powerful tools and abstractions for building intelligent systems. By leveraging these frameworks, developers can save time and effort while benefiting from the collective knowledge and best practices of the AI community.

## Applying the Lessons

To put these lessons into practice, consider the following steps:

<Steps>
### Step 1

Clearly define the input-output relationships for your AI system. Identify the types of inputs your model will receive and the expected outputs it should generate.

### Step 2

Incorporate structured reasoning techniques into your AI pipeline. Consider using atomic reasoning modules or compiling reasoning for specific tasks to improve the quality and coherence of your model's outputs.

### Step 3

Implement verification mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your AI system's outputs. This can include cross-referencing with trusted sources, manual review by experts, or additional validation layers.

### Step 4

Explore and leverage existing AI frameworks, such as DSPy, to streamline your development process and benefit from the collective knowledge of the AI community.
</Steps>

By applying these lessons from Jason Liu, developers can create more robust, reliable, and efficient AI systems that generate high-quality outputs and provide value to users.
