# AI Frameworks: LangChain vs. DSPy

In this section, we'll explore the differences between two popular AI frameworks: [LangChain](/langchain-intro) and [DSPy](/dspy-intro). Chris Dossman, an AI startup founder, shares his insights on why he prefers DSPy over LangChain for his projects.

LangChain and DSPy are both powerful tools for building applications with large language models (LLMs). However, they have distinct philosophies and approaches to working with LLMs.

## Key Differences

- **Abstraction Level**: LangChain provides high-level abstractions for common tasks, such as question-answering and text summarization. On the other hand, DSPy focuses on a lower-level, more flexible approach, allowing developers to define input-output relationships and create structured reasoning workflows.

- **Customization**: While LangChain offers pre-built chains for various use cases, DSPy encourages developers to build their own examples and tailor the framework to their specific needs. This flexibility is particularly valuable when working with complex or domain-specific tasks.

- **Structured Reasoning**: DSPy places a strong emphasis on structured reasoning, providing tools for defining clear input-output relationships and creating multi-step reasoning workflows. This approach helps developers think more critically about the desired outcomes and design effective prompts accordingly.

## Why Chris Prefers DSPy

Chris highlights several reasons why he favors DSPy over LangChain for his AI startup:

1. **Closer to the Metal**: DSPy allows developers to work closer to the underlying language model, providing more control over the prompting process and enabling fine-grained optimizations.

2. **Flexible Examples**: With DSPy, Chris can easily build his own examples and tailor them to his specific use case, ensuring that the model is trained on relevant and high-quality data.

3. **Structured Reasoning Workflows**: DSPy's emphasis on structured reasoning aligns well with Chris's goal of creating accurate and efficient AI systems. By breaking down problems into smaller steps and defining clear input-output relationships, he can achieve better results with fewer model calls.

4. **Extensibility**: DSPy's modular architecture makes it easy to extend and integrate with other tools and frameworks, allowing Chris to build more comprehensive AI solutions.

While LangChain is a valuable tool in its own right, Chris finds that DSPy's approach resonates better with his needs as an AI startup founder. The framework's flexibility, structured reasoning capabilities, and extensibility make it a powerful choice for building cutting-edge AI applications.
