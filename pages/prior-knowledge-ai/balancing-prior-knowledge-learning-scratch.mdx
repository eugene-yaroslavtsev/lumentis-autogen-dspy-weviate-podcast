# Balancing Prior Knowledge and Learning from Scratch

In the world of AI development, there's an ongoing debate about the role of prior knowledge in AI systems. Should we focus on incorporating as much prior knowledge as possible, or should we let AI systems learn from scratch? Let's explore the tradeoffs and considerations involved in this decision.

## The Case for Prior Knowledge

Incorporating prior knowledge into AI systems can offer several benefits:

- **Faster learning:** By providing AI systems with relevant information and reasoning structures, they can learn and adapt more quickly to new tasks.
- **Improved efficiency:** Prior knowledge can help AI systems focus on the most relevant information and avoid wasting computational resources on irrelevant data.
- **Enhanced interpretability:** When AI systems rely on structured prior knowledge, it becomes easier for humans to understand and interpret their decision-making process.

A great example of incorporating prior knowledge is the use of pre-trained language models like GPT-3 or BERT. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to capture general language understanding and perform well on various natural language tasks.

## The Case for Learning from Scratch

On the other hand, proponents of learning from scratch argue that:

- **Unbiased learning:** By minimizing the influence of prior knowledge, AI systems can learn from data without being constrained by preconceived notions or biases.
- **Discovering novel solutions:** Learning from scratch allows AI systems to explore a wider range of possibilities and potentially discover novel solutions that may not have been considered by human experts.
- **Adaptability to new domains:** AI systems that learn from scratch can be more easily adapted to new domains or tasks, as they are not tied to specific prior knowledge structures.

A famous example of learning from scratch is AlphaGo Zero, a version of DeepMind's Go-playing AI that learned to play the game at a superhuman level without any prior knowledge of Go strategies. It achieved this by playing millions of games against itself and learning from scratch.

## Finding the Right Balance

In practice, the best approach often lies somewhere between these two extremes. The ideal balance between prior knowledge and learning from scratch depends on the specific task, available data, and desired outcomes.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Identify the task and available data

Consider the complexity of the task and the amount and quality of available data. Tasks with limited data may benefit more from incorporating prior knowledge, while tasks with abundant data may allow for more learning from scratch.

### Step 2: Determine the desired outcomes

Clarify the goals and requirements of the AI system. If interpretability and fast adaptation are crucial, prior knowledge may be more valuable. If unbiased exploration and novel solutions are prioritized, learning from scratch may be preferred.

### Step 3: Experiment with different approaches

Try incorporating different levels of prior knowledge and compare the results. Iteratively adjust the balance based on the system's performance and alignment with the desired outcomes.

In [Chris Dossman's self-discover implementation](/self-discover-dspy) in DSPy, he strikes a balance by providing a set of atomic reasoning modules as prior knowledge, while allowing the system to adapt and compile these modules for specific tasks. This approach leverages the benefits of both prior knowledge and task-specific learning.

By carefully considering the tradeoffs and finding the right balance between prior knowledge and learning from scratch, AI developers can create systems that are efficient, adaptable, and aligned with their goals.
