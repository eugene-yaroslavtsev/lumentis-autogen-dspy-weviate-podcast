# Self-Discover in DSPy

Chris Dossman, the founder of Dicer AI, has implemented a powerful capability called "self-discover" within the DSPy framework. This innovative feature enables AI systems to search for their own reasoning and compile themselves, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI technology.

  Self-discover is an engineering hack that allows for the generation of high-quality training data, similar to what companies like Google and DeepMind might be using internally.

The self-discover capability is based on the concept of "rag for thought," which is a more efficient alternative to techniques like "tree of thought." While tree of thought requires running the language model 50-60 times to build a tree of possible paths, self-discover achieves better results with just four calls, significantly reducing costs and improving output quality.

At the core of self-discover are [atomic reasoning modules](/self-discover-dspy/atomic-reasoning-modules), which are pre-defined questions or prompts that help guide the AI system's reasoning process. These modules cover a wide range of reasoning strategies, such as:

- Devising experiments to solve problems
- Simplifying problems to make them easier to solve
- Identifying physical constraints like limited resources or space

The self-discover process consists of four distinct steps:

1. **Select:** Choose the most relevant reasoning modules for the given task.
2. **Adapt:** Modify the selected modules to fit the specific task at hand.
3. **Plan:** Create a step-by-step guide with descriptions and actions for each step.
4. **Solve:** Execute the plan, solving each step independently to arrive at the final answer.

By breaking down the reasoning process into these steps and leveraging the power of atomic reasoning modules, self-discover enables AI systems to generate high-quality, well-thought-out solutions to complex problems.

  Self-discover has been shown to outperform other prompting techniques, including chain of thought, in terms of output quality and cost-effectiveness.

One of the key advantages of self-discover is its flexibility. The capability can be wrapped around any task or prompt, making it a versatile tool for enhancing AI performance across a wide range of applications. As Chris continues to refactor Dicer AI's pipelines using DSPy, he plans to incorporate self-discover to improve results and streamline processes.
