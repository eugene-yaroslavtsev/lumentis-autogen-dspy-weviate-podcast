# Compiling Reasoning for Specific Tasks

In the [Self-Discover in DSPy](/self-discover-dspy) section, we introduced the concept of [atomic reasoning modules](/self-discover-dspy/atomic-reasoning-modules) and how they contribute to structured reasoning in AI systems. Now, let's dive deeper into how self-discover adapts and compiles these reasoning modules for specific tasks, ultimately improving output quality and efficiency.

## Adapting Reasoning Modules

One of the key features of self-discover is its ability to adapt general reasoning modules to the specific task at hand. This process involves:

1. **Selecting relevant modules**: Self-discover identifies the reasoning modules that are most applicable to the given task.

2. **Customizing module prompts**: The selected modules are then customized to include task-specific information and context.

3. **Generating adapted modules**: The result is a set of adapted reasoning modules tailored to the specific task, providing a more targeted approach to problem-solving.

By adapting reasoning modules to the task, self-discover ensures that the AI system focuses on the most relevant aspects of the problem, leading to more accurate and efficient solutions.

## Compiling Adapted Modules

Once the reasoning modules have been adapted, self-discover compiles them into a structured reasoning plan. This process involves:

<Steps>
### Step 1: Creating a reasoning structure

The adapted modules are organized into a step-by-step reasoning structure, outlining the sequence of actions and thought processes required to solve the task.

### Step 2: Generating descriptions and actions

For each step in the reasoning structure, self-discover generates a description of the problem at that stage and the specific action or steps the AI should take to progress towards a solution.

### Step 3: Solving the task

The compiled reasoning structure is then used to guide the AI system through the problem-solving process, ensuring a systematic and well-defined approach to the task.
</Steps>

By compiling the adapted reasoning modules into a structured plan, self-discover enables AI systems to tackle complex tasks more effectively and efficiently.

## Benefits of Compiling Reasoning

Compiling reasoning for specific tasks offers several key benefits:

- **Improved output quality**: By focusing on task-relevant reasoning modules and following a structured plan, AI systems can generate higher-quality outputs that are more accurate and coherent.

- **Reduced computational cost**: Compiling reasoning helps AI systems avoid unnecessary or irrelevant computations, ultimately reducing the overall computational cost of problem-solving.

- **Enhanced interpretability**: The structured reasoning plan generated by self-discover makes it easier for humans to understand and interpret the AI system's thought process, promoting transparency and trust.
